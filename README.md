## CMYKify

### Overview
CMYKify is an open-source project that helps you convert AI-generated RGB images into a print-ready CMYK format with an embedded color profile. It consists of two main components:
1. A Python library that handles image conversion.
2. A minimal web service demonstrating how to use the library.

#### Project Status
- **Proof of Concept:** This project aims to serve as a reference implementation and is not optimized for production use.
